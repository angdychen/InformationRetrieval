That time of year thou mayst in me behold
When yellow leaves , or none, or few , do hang
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold ,
Bare ruin'd choirs , where late the sweet birds sang .
In me thou seest the twilight of such day
As after sunset fadeth in the west ,
Which by and by black night doth take away ,
Death's second self , that seals up all in rest .
In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie ,
As the death-bed whereon it must expire
Consumed with that which it was nourish'd by .
This thou perceivest, which makes thy love more strong ,
To love that well which thou must leave ere long

在我身上你或许会看见秋天，
当黄叶，或尽脱，或只三三两两
挂在瑟缩的枯枝上索索抖颤--
荒废的歌坛，那里百鸟曾合唱。
在我身上你或许会看见暮霭，
它在日落后向西方徐徐消退：
黑夜，死的化身，渐渐把它赶开，
严静的安息笼住纷纭的万类。
在我身上你或许全看见余烬，
它在青春的寒灰里奄奄一息，
在惨淡灵床上早晚总要断魂，
给那滋养过它的烈焰所销毁。
看见了这些，你的爱就会加强，
因为他转瞬要辞你溘然长往。
